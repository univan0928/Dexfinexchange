/* BridgeableToken Smart Contract
*  @noot
*  this contract implements functionality for bridging of an erc20/erc223 token
*  for a token to be bridgeable, the bridge contract needs to be able to transfer 
*  the token to a recipient on the receiving chain.
*  with a usual erc20 implementation, the bridge would need approval to transfer
*  tokens, otherwise the transfer will fail.
